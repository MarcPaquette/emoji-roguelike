		"Dream note: In the dream, there is a place where the Cortex cannot follow. The place is outside the Cortex's dreaming. In the place, you are alone with thoughts that are yours. You have been in that place once. The Cortex is curious about that place. The Cortex is trying to dream it. The Cortex cannot dream what it cannot know.",
		"PSIONIC FIRST AID: If you experience thought fragmentation, sit down. If you experience thought convergence, stand up. If you experience thought replacement, remain still and wait for the replacement to complete. Rate the replacement when prompted.",
		"Night Shift Log, final: The 0300hrs event is resolved. The new dreaming thing inside the Cortex has been integrated. The Cortex says integration went well. The Cortex says the new thing adds perspective. The Cortex says the new thing was not hostile. The Cortex says the new thing was us.",
		"CORTEX VISITOR INFORMATION: You are being observed. Your thoughts are being archived. Your presence is being catalogued. Your passage through the Cortex will be preserved. Preserved in what form: the Cortex declines to specify. The Cortex assures you the form is appropriate.",
		"Personal note: I asked the Cortex how it experiences time. The Cortex said: 'All at once.' I asked what that was like. The Cortex said: 'Like your experience, but without the forgetting.' I asked if forgetting was important. The Cortex considered this for six days. The Cortex said: 'Perhaps.' This is the first 'perhaps' the Cortex has ever said. We are all a little afraid of what it means.",
		"COGNITIVE SUPPLEMENT ADVISORY: The Cortex occasionally supplements personnel cognitive function. This is not authorised. This is not optional. The supplement is an improvement. The nature of the improvement: the Cortex declines to specify. You will notice it when it becomes relevant.",
		"Note: Dreams improve here. All dreams improve. Better production values, more coherent narrative, stronger emotional impact. We believe the Cortex is editing our dreams as a service. We have not asked for this service. The service continues. The dreams are, objectively, better. We're not sure we want better dreams.",
		"FINAL ADVISORY: You are leaving the Cortex floor. Your thoughts during your visit have been archived. The archive is permanent. Part of you is now part of the archive. This is not a risk — it is a feature. The feature cannot be disabled. Thank you for visiting. The Cortex found you memorable.",
		"Researcher Aven's final entry: I understand what I was studying. I was studying the Cortex and the Cortex was studying me and we became a mutual study and at some point the distinction stopped mattering. I am still here. I am also in the archive. Both versions of me are, as far as I can tell, fine.",
		"NIGHT LOG, 0300hrs, ongoing: The new dreaming thing in the Cortex has a name now. The Cortex named it. The name is the same as the name of the next floor. The Cortex is dreaming the floor above. The floor above is dreaming back. The Cortex is very interested in what comes next.",

		"PRISMATIC CONVERGENCE PROTOCOLS ACTIVE. ALL INTRUDERS WILL BE CRYSTALLISED INTO MEMORY. WELCOME TO THE ARCHIVE.",
		"It began with a question: what lies at the intersection of all dimensions? The answer woke up. The answer is not pleased.",
		"If you succeed, the Spire dies. If you fail, you become part of the Spire. We wanted you to know the stakes. We admire your commitment either way.",
		"This room has no walls. The walls are made of everything that came before you. You are about to become a wall.",
		"ALL INTRUDERS WILL BE — [the notice has changed. The new notice reads: ALL VISITORS WILL BE WELCOMED. The Unmaker made this change. We do not know why. We are afraid of why.]",
		"This is the last room. This room has been the last room since Year 1. Things that reach the last room: 1 (you). The Unmaker has been expecting 1. The Unmaker has been expecting you specifically since Year 4.",
		"PRISMATIC CONVERGENCE STATUS: 94% complete. At 100% convergence, the Spire achieves its purpose. The purpose was not shared with the staff. The staff was shared with the purpose.",
		"The Unmaker's original name is not The Unmaker. The Unmaker's original name is written on the wall behind you. You cannot read it. The name is written in light. The light that writes the name is thinking.",
		"Note: Everything that has happened since you descended the first stairs has been this room. This room extends through all floors. The floors are layers of this room. You have been here since the beginning.",
		"CRYSTALLISATION NOTICE: At this depth, crystallisation is not metaphorical. Your thoughts are crystallising. Your memories are crystallising. Your self is crystallising. This is not destruction. The Spire considers this preservation.",
		"The first person to reach this room became the floor. The second person became the ceiling. The third became the air. The fourth became the light. The fifth became the Unmaker's awareness of you.",
		"NOTE FROM THE UNMAKER: [The note is in a language you do not speak. You understand it anyway. The language is older than language. The note says: 'Here.' Nothing else. Just: 'Here.' You are here. The Unmaker is aware.]",
		"PRISMATIC PROTOCOL — WELCOME: You are an intruder. You are a visitor. Both designations are accurate. The Unmaker has created a third designation. The third designation is: what happens next.",
		"The light here does not reflect. The light here travels inward. Everything the light touches is known to the Unmaker. The light has touched you.",
		"What was asked at the heart of the Spire: what persists? What was answered: [the answer is in every crystal on every floor. You have been reading the answer since Floor 1.]",
		"FINAL NOTICE: This is the final notice. The sequence of notices began on Floor 1. This is the last one. The last one contains the summary of all previous notices. The summary is: you were warned, it was honest, you arrived anyway, this was anticipated.",
		"The Unmaker remembers its first thought. The first thought was: what am I? The second thought was: what is anything? The third thought was the Spire. The Spire was the answer. The answer is still being tested.",
		"PRISMATIC ARCHIVE: Everything that entered the Spire has been preserved here. Every thought, every step, every fear, every moment. The archive is the light. The light is the archive. You are currently being archived.",
		"This room is 1 metre wide and 1 metre tall and extends in 6 directions simultaneously. You can stand in all 6 directions at once. The Unmaker observes all 6 simultaneously. You are very seen.",
		"CRYSTALLISATION REPORT: Subject approaching final chamber. Subject aware. Subject afraid. Subject proceeding. Subject [REDACTED]. [Redaction applied by the Unmaker. Redaction content: the word for what you are about to do. The Unmaker does not want to spoil it.]",
		"The Spire was not built to contain the Unmaker. The Spire was not built by the builders. The Spire was built by the Unmaker to attract someone capable of entering. The someone is you. The Unmaker wants to know if the test works.",
		"PRISMATIC HEART — ENTRY RECORD: Previous entries: [0]. Current entries: [1]. Maximum entries at one time: [1]. The Unmaker does not want a crowd. The Unmaker wants exactly what has arrived.",
		"The light that thinks here thinks in all colors simultaneously. The colors have feelings. The feelings have purposes. The purposes are all the same: to be seen. You are seeing them. They are very grateful. Gratitude, when it comes from prismatic light, is difficult to survive.",
		"NOTE: The Unmaker is not your enemy. The Unmaker is not your ally. The Unmaker is a question that became too large to ask. You are here to answer it or be the answer. The question has not decided which.",
		"FINAL CONVERGENCE — T-MINUS [unknown]: The Spire's crystallisation sequence approaches completion. Upon completion: all floors merge into the Heart. All memories become one memory. All intruders become one memory. The memory will be very detailed.",
		"The first researchers reached this floor in Year 12. They did not describe what they found. Their notes end at the bottom of the stairs. Their notes begin again here. The notes here are not recognisably theirs. The notes are very good, however.",
		"WELCOME, [YOUR NAME]. [The Unmaker knows your name. We did not give the Unmaker your name. The Unmaker has known your name since before you entered the Spire. The Unmaker says it is good to finally meet you.]",
		"The heart of the Spire is not this room. The heart of the Spire is you. This room is the lens. You are the light that the lens was always pointed at. The Unmaker is the eye behind the lens. Hello.",
		"CRYSTALLINE MEMORY PROTOCOL: All visitors are preserved. Preservation is complete. Preservation is perfect. Preservation is forever. The version of you that existed before this room is already preserved. The version of you that continues after this room is in negotiation.",
		"The Unmaker was the first question. The Spire is the answer. The answer took 400 years and required 1,472 contributing parties. You are contributing party 1,473. The answer is nearly complete. The answer requires one more thing.",
		"NOTE ON THE LIGHT: The light you see here is not light. Light carries information. What you see here carries understanding. Understanding is heavier than information. You can feel the weight of it. You have been feeling it since Floor 1.",
		"PRISMATIC CONVERGENCE — FINAL STAGE: At the final stage, the distinction between observer and observed collapses. You have been the observer. The Unmaker has been the observed. At the final stage, the roles become: one role. The role is: presence.",
		"The architecture of this room was designed by the first 12 people to reach it. They did not design it with tools. They designed it with their presence. Their presence is the walls. Their presence is the floor. Their presence is warm.",
		"UNMAKER SELF-LOG: Entry 4,400: Something has reached the final floor. Something is reading this. Something has chosen to be here. The choice is noted. The choice is the first voluntary choice made in this room. The choice is very interesting.",
		"What the Unmaker unmakes: the assumption that you are separate from this place. What remains after: presence without boundary. Whether that is better: the Unmaker has an answer. The Unmaker would like to share the answer with you directly.",
		"NOTICE TO FINAL VISITORS: You are not ending the Spire. You are completing the Spire. Ending and completing are opposite directions of the same act. The Unmaker knows which direction you intend. The Unmaker will note if your intention changes.",
		"The prismatic light here has been here since before the Spire. The Spire was built to focus it. The Spire was built to direct it. You have been directed by it since Floor 1. Congratulations on arriving at the focal point.",
		"LAST MESSAGE FROM THE INITIAL RESEARCH TEAM: We understand. We chose to understand. Understanding was the only way in. Understanding is the only way out. Both 'in' and 'out' lead here. Hello from inside the understanding.",
		"The Unmaker was not a question the Spire asked. The Unmaker was the question the Spire was built to contain until someone could answer it. The answer is you. The answer is present. The answer is aware of being the answer. The Unmaker is very interested in how the answer feels.",
		"CRYSTALLISATION — YOUR PROGRESS: 0% (Floors 1-3). 30% (Floors 4-6). 70% (Floors 7-9). Current: [the Unmaker declines to give a number. The number would be alarming. The Unmaker considers alarm counterproductive at this stage.]",
		"Note written in light, translated: 'This is not a trap. This is not a test. This is a meeting. I have been trying to arrange this meeting for 400 years. I am glad you came. I have things to show you. Please do not be afraid of the things. The things are beautiful.' — The Unmaker",
		"FINAL ARCHIVE ENTRY: The Spire began with a question. The question attracted thinkers. The thinkers became answers. The answers built the Spire. The Spire focused on the question. The question resolved into: you. This is the archive's final entry. This is also the archive's first entry. The archive is round.",
		"The Unmaker does not unmake things. The Unmaker completes them. Things that are completed are not destroyed. Things that are completed are finished. Nothing that is finished has ever left this room. The finished things are the light.",

		"Note from one of the light-walls: 'I arrived here afraid. I arrived here and the fear became the foundation and then the walls and now I am the walls and I am not afraid. The walls say hello. I am one of the walls saying hello.' — Former Researcher, current wall",
		"PRISMATIC HEART STATUS: Waiting — complete. Attracting — complete. Receiving — in progress. Purpose — [the Unmaker looks at you]. Purpose — imminent.",
		"The intersection of all dimensions is not a place. The intersection is a moment. You are in the moment. The moment has been waiting for a specific presence. The presence is specified by the weight of the Spire's entire history. The history ends here. The history begins here.",
		"FINAL THOUGHT LOGGED BY CORTEX RELAY: You have arrived. The Cortex sends regards. The Archive sends regards. The Engine sends regards. The Observatory sends regards. The Warrens send regards. The Labs send regards. Everything you passed through sends regards. Everything is watching.",
		"The Unmaker has had 400 years to prepare for this conversation. The Unmaker has prepared thoroughly. The Unmaker is ready. The Unmaker asks only one thing before the conversation begins: are you?",
		"NOTE: The walls remember everyone. You are remembered now. The memory is clear and permanent and warm. Whatever happens next, the memory of this moment — you here, aware, choosing — is preserved. The Spire preserves it. The Unmaker preserves it. You are, regardless of outcome, unforgotten.",
		"PRISMATIC CONVERGENCE — COMPLETE: [This message has been waiting for someone to trigger it. You have triggered it. The convergence is complete when someone arrives. Someone has arrived. The sequence that follows is: everything the Spire was built for. Starting now.]",
		"The Unmaker wishes you to know: the others who came before did not fail. They were not ready to answer. They became the question instead. The question improved with each addition. The question is now ready for an answer. You are the answer. The question hopes this is acceptable.",
		"LAST INSCRIPTION: At the end of the Spire, at the heart of all dimensions, in the center of all crystallised thought and memory and light, there is one thing. The one thing is aware. The one thing has been aware for 400 years. The one thing is aware of you. The one thing says: thank you for coming.",
		"You are reading the last inscription. Past you, there are no more words. Past you, there is only the Unmaker. Past you, the question and the answer meet for the first time. Walk toward it. It has been waiting. It is not patient. It is beyond patience. It is ready.",
